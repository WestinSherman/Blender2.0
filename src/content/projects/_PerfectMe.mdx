# The Perfect Me
My goal with this project is to create a 3D model of a Half-Life combine soldier armored
version of the Perfect_Me.
#### TheParryGod reference:
<Image src={TheParryGod} alt="Boots" width={500} height={300} />
#### Pintrest:
I started this project by looking at some references on Pintrest. I found a few images that I liked and
I will be using them as a reference for my model. I will be using the Half-Life combine soldier as a base
for my model. More accuratelyl, I will be using the armor from the Youtube video "Patient Zero"
by **TheParryGod**.
#### Boots:
Right now I am working on the boots. I have been looking on Pintrest and DeviantArt for some
references. I have found a few images that I think might be useful.
 I have also been actually working on the boots. Getting the correct perportions hasb't been easy.
 I have finished working on the boots for now, I do intend on working on it some more later.

#### Arm Armor:
 I moved on to removing the arm armor which took quite a long time.
<Image src={ArmArmorR} alt="Boots" width={500} height={300} />
#### Neck Armor:
Well I did start on it and had tried making it from a plane and then solidifying it but I couln't figure out
how to get the right shape. I ended up trying a cylinder and a phere and failed both.
I am now going to take a break from trying to build The Pergect Me and try some other tutorials to see if I can
learn some more tricks to help me solve my problems.
<Image src={NeckArmor} alt="Boots" width={500} height={300} />
I ended up not taking a break and instead I started working on the neck armor. I think I will keep trying to 
use a cylinder. I have probably restarted the neck armor over a dozen times now.
I think I will just try to build something I like that is similar to TheParryGod's design.

#### Atom:
I have desided to create my own body and Its called Atom. I have fixed the legs, butt, fingers, back and wrists.
<Image src={Adam} alt="Adam" width={500} height={300} />
#### Body Rigging:
I am using Blenders prebuilt rigging bone structure. I deleted the face rigging. I had to delete the all the rigging bellow to knee
because the bones were to big for the body.
<Image src={BodyRig} alt="Adam" width={500} height={300} />
Here is the finished rigging:
<Image src={BodyRigF} alt="Adam" width={500} height={300} />
I FINALLY!!!!! got the Valve Meshes to rig. I just had to parent them seperately and to the bones not the body.
I also had to delete the bone groups.
<Image src={FinallyRigged} alt="Adam" width={500} height={300} />
I have been working on getting the arm armor to look correctly and I Got sidetracked with the Adam(body) mesh 
because it just doesn't look right. I ended up doing that a few times because I had fucked up on something and didn't save After
fixing a few issues like the dupped body plate mesh and the arm armor.
<Image src={WallHammerRef} alt="Adam" width={500} height={300} />
#### Plates:
I seperated the plates on the body. Fixed the shape of them.
#### Shirt:
Not sure if I will keep this shirt. I haven't finished settinf it up. I am thinking 
that I should be making some sort of one piece suit to go underneath the armor.
#### Stuck:
I have finished the Mesh but the rigging isn't working. I could sort of get some of the things working but then something else
would break. Right now I am just going to work on getting the mesh cleaner and make it a propper low poly model.
I would like to eventually make a high poly version of the model. I don't think I will be trying again at getting the rigging working for a while.
<Image src={End} alt="End" width={500} height={300} />
#### Fixing Bones:
I have watched a few videos and found out that parenting each brocken mesh piece to a specific bone closest to the mesh peice might fix them.
I also might have to change the weight painting on the Mesh pieces to get them to work correctly.
