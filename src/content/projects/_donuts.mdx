# Blender Guru's Donut Tutorial
I started this documentation of my Blender journey late in the game.
I dont really recall the very beginning, and I will start off at
Part9: Layout of the Blender Guru's Donut tutorial Because thats where I am at.
I will be using this page to document my progress and share my thoughts
on the process. I will be using the Blender Guru's Donut tutorial as a guide.

This is what my donuts look like so far:
<Image src={Wallpaper} alt="My donut" width={500} height={300} />

## Part 9: Layout
The lighting is definitely off. The next video is about lighting.
Getting the front donut to sit properly on the table was a bit finicky.

## Part 10: Lighting
Finished the lighting and set the website index page `background-size` to cover which
just makes the image change its size to properly fit the tab screen size.
Having issues with making the donut lighting match the videos. The reytracing helped a
bit, but the lighting is still off. I will have to play around with the lighting settings
or just move on.

## Part 11: Compositing
I think iI'm done working on the donut tutorial. I will be moving on to the next project.
